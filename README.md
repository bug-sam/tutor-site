# Tutor Site

This is my submission for my final project for CS338 at Drexel University.

It's a site where people can create requests for tutoring.

Other users who are looking for tutoring work can browse the requests,
and if they find one they are interested in, they can reach out to the person who created the request.


This site uses Next.js for its front-end and Django Rest Frameword for its back-end.
